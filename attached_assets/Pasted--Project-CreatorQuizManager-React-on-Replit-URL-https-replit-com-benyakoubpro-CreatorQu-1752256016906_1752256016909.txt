🧩 Objective:
Deliver a complete, smooth, and aesthetically polished Arabic experience (RTL) for my React application.

---

🔴 **Current Issues**:
- Many text strings appear in Arabic, but the UI still feels unnatural and broken.
- The layout feels "cringy": not professional, clunky spacing, misaligned buttons, poor padding.
- Icons and interactive elements don’t adapt visually or behaviorally to RTL.
- Font choice and line spacing don’t respect Arabic readability standards.
- Some components become unresponsive or shift awkwardly when switching to Arabic.
- Navigation and form fields feel visually *off* (asymmetry, visual noise, or collapse).

🎯 **Target Outcome**:
Make the Arabic version of the site feel **native, professional, clean, and pleasant**, like a real Arabic-first web app. Not just a reversed English layout.

## ✅ Arabic UI Checklist:

### 1. 🌐 Direction & Structure
- Automatically set `dir="rtl"` on `<html>` or `<body>` when Arabic is selected.
- Use logical CSS properties: `margin-inline-start`, `padding-inline-end`, `text-align`, etc.
- Flip `flex-direction` for flexboxes: `row-reverse` where needed.
- Use `clsx` or conditional classes in React to apply layout-direction styles dynamically.

### 2. 🧠 Typography & Fonts
- Integrate high-quality Arabic fonts:
  - Suggested: `Cairo`, `Tajawal`, `Noto Kufi Arabic`, or `Amiri`
  - Use `font-display: swap;` for performance
- Adjust `line-height`, `letter-spacing`, and `font-weight` for readability.
- Arabic characters need more vertical spacing and softer weight than Latin.

### 3. 🎨 Layout Adjustments (RTL Specific)
- Navbar: menu should align right, dropdown arrows flip, hamburger icon animates RTL.
- Buttons: padding/margins should feel consistent with Arabic reading flow.
- Modals, cards, and tooltips: anchor position and close buttons should reverse.
- Forms:
  - Input labels align right
  - Placeholder text is Arabic, and aligns properly
  - Error messages and validation messages follow RTL flow
- Icons:
  - Use RTL-aware icons or flip chevrons/arrows using `transform: scaleX(-1);`

### 4. ⚙️ Functional Expectations
- Switching to Arabic dynamically triggers:
  - `html[dir="rtl"]`
  - Theme or component layout updates (via state or Context API)
- Arabic layout must work at all screen sizes (responsive)
- RTL behavior should not cause side effects or regressions in the English version

🧪 Test Expectations:
- ✅ No overflow or collapsed components
- ✅ Correct font and spacing across all devices
- ✅ Functional parity with English version
- ✅ RTL works in desktop and mobile views
- ✅ Visual polish with a native Arabic feel
- ✅ No visual glitches, misalignment, or broken navigation

📣 Final Notes:
Please deliver a **stable and aesthetically coherent RTL version** of the site, following design best practices for Arabic UI/UX.

I am not looking for a quick CSS hack, but a **clean, scalable, professional multilingual app**, where Arabic looks and feels like it was designed for Arabic users — not just translated from English.

No regressions, no layout bugs, and polished typography/layout for Arabic.
