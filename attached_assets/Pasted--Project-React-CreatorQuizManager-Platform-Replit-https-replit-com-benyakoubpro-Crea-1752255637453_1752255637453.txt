🛠️ **Issue Description**:
The application is designed to support multiple languages (including Arabic), but when I switch the interface to Arabic, the UI breaks or becomes visually degraded.

🧪 **Observed Problems**:
- Layout shifts unexpectedly (menus, cards, and buttons break alignment)
- Text overlaps, especially on buttons and form fields
- Directional icons (e.g., arrows, chevrons) point in the wrong direction
- The site does not fully switch to RTL layout — only the text language changes
- Fonts do not adapt properly for Arabic readability
- Flex/grid components behave inconsistently (especially in nested layouts)

🎯 **Goal**:
Ensure full **RTL (right-to-left)** support and a visually polished UI when Arabic is selected:

1. ✅ When Arabic is chosen, the whole UI should switch to `dir="rtl"` mode globally.
2. ✅ Components must **maintain their design integrity and responsiveness**.
3. ✅ Use appropriate **Arabic fonts** such as `Cairo`, `Tajawal`, or `Noto Kufi Arabic`.
4. ✅ UI components like navbar, sidebars, dropdowns, buttons, inputs, modals, and tooltips should mirror correctly.
5. ✅ Use **logical CSS properties** (`margin-inline-start`, `padding-inline-end`, `text-align`, `flex-direction`) to allow bidirectional support.
6. ✅ **No regressions** in English or other LTR languages.
7. ✅ Smooth transitions when switching languages dynamically.

📦 **Tech Stack**:
- React.js (Functional Components + Hooks)
- React Router
- Possibly i18n: `react-i18next` or manual translation handling
- CSS: Plain CSS or TailwindCSS (please confirm if needed)
- Hosted on Replit

📂 **Suggestions**:
- Set `dir="rtl"` dynamically on `<html>` or top-level `<div>` based on selected language.
- Use `useEffect` in App.jsx to handle direction updates.
- Isolate direction-specific CSS in conditional classes or use a utility like `clsx`.
- For icons, consider RTL-aware replacements (e.g., flip arrows when `dir="rtl"`).
- Consider Arabic-optimized fonts via Google Fonts.
